A job trend analysis in Excel


It’s been over a year since I’ve been trying to get into the dynamic job market as a self-motivated Data Analyst, it was only in the past few months that I realised that I’ve been focusing too much on certifications, online courses, and tutorials instead of applying my knowledge on more impactful projects.

Hence this is my first “actual” project, I have done a few but they’re not documented and honestly, they’re just all over the place….anyway we’re here now and that’s all that matters. My tedious and relatively long job-hunting process is the reason I decided to try to “decode” the ever-evolving job trends primarily in the USA.

Initially, I wanted to focus on tech-related roles only but I struggled to find captivating and distinctive datasets (still fairly new at this). I then switched gears, diving into all kinds of industries and job roles. It’s been quite a process, please kindly head to my Medium page to find out more.
